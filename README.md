# Shadows of Yesterday

A psychological time-loop narrative game built in Python and Pygame, created as part of **Moonshot**, a 4‑day hackathon for high schoolers in Orlando, Florida, featuring visits to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Universal Studios.

## About the Game

You wake up on the same day—24th of July—over and over again.  
At first, you try to break the loop with pain and risk. Then you start testing reality itself.  
Eventually, you realise the city around you is less a real place and more a shifting mindscape built on someone else’s pain.

Across 13 chapters, you:

- Relive the same day through different lenses: body, social, dream, and memory.
- Meet distorted versions of the same people: Mr. Jüger, the homeless man, the boy in the classroom, and the voices in your head.
- Watch the city drift slightly each loop, revealing that this isn’t a clean time reset, but a psychological reconstruction.

The story ends not with a clean explanation, but with a choice:  
restart the day, or quit.
