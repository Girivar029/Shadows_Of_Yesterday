# Story Progression

## Chapter 1: A New Morning
Wake up in your familiar room, sensing something's off. Note-taking hint encourages external puzzle engagement. Check watch (7.00 AM, 24th July) or stay in bed contemplating.

**Decision 1: Stay in bed -> Try Sleeping**
- Loop back to wake up or mumble gibberish "Vqtb P kfku ekmrydN" (cipher clue!) before passing out, restarting the day.

**Decision 2: Get up -> Go outside**
Choose between greeting mysterious man (name forgotten) or jogging.

**Path A: Talk to man**
- Ask why road is empty, he laughs saying it's obvious.
Chat Longer -> hear crying voice (yourself?) -> jolt awake.

**Path B: Jog**
- Become exhausted, curse self. Push harder -> see shadow-self smiling at pain -> faint. Or buy water from empty shop -> drink -> hear fearful voice -> wake up.

**Chapter 1 Convergence:** ALL paths lead to waking up with alarm, hearing voices/people, checking digital  
clock (same date/time).

## Chapter 2: A New Beginning
Same day repeats (dream?). Check clock (7.00 AM, 24thJuly). Pinch self until bleeding to test reality -> apply bandids -> notice many bandids. Mom"s note warns "apply bandids everytime... do not bleed out like other times." Flashback of harm -> sweat.

**Outside Choices:**
- **Grred Mr. Jager** (now remembered): He notices forearm wound.
  -**Truth:** Pinched after bad dream -> "be careful with body."
  -**Lie:** Hammer accident -> he laughs at frail body.
  -**Confront laugh** -> hit by truck -> faint.
-**Jog** -> hit by car -> faint.
All paths -> Chapter 3.

## Chapter 3: A New Day?
Wake up, check surroundings -> discover nail scratches hidden in fresh paint (future self's despair marks).Clock confirms same time/date. Outside -> greet Mr. Jager or walk carefully.

**Paths Lead to death:**
- **Phone -> School -> Thirsty man**
  -Give water -> stabbed in chain snatching.
  -Walk away -> Morse code on wall ".. / ... . . / -,-- --- ..- .-. / -... .-.. --- --- -.. -.-- / -... .- -.-. -.- .-.-.-" (SAVE YOUR BODY BACK.) -> stabbed in robbery.
  - ** Walk carefully -> Shop** (shopkeeper offers bandages)
  -> still stabbed in crossfire.
  ALL -> Chapter 4.

  ## Chapter 4: The Loop Closes
  Rush to clock -> same day/time. Pinch/needle test -> more pain, apply bandaid. Mr . Jager warns "be careful with body, wear bandaids." Theories:
  - **Time loop test:** Terrace suicide -> step back scared.
  - **Dream test:** Needle -> real pain.

  **Choices converge:** Walk cautiously, ignore dangers -> still trpped. Realization dawns: marks, voices, bandaids, warnings all point to self-destructive cycle.
