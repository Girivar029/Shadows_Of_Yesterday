# Story Progression

This is a **text-first psychological horror** experience.
No visual are required: the game learns on repetition,word choice, mismatched dialogue, timing, subtle formating, and the player's imagination. Psychological horror hits harder when the player fills in the gaps.

## Core Loop Structure

The game is split in to "days" or chapters.Each loop begins similarly but shifts in small, unnerving ways.

**Format example:**

Day 1
08:12 AM
You wake up with a ringing in your ears. The same dream again.

Then the player makes choices.

Between loops, changes are purely textual:
- An NPC repeats a sentence but with one wrong word.
- A line appears in ALL CAPS for a moment before normal text returns.
- The time stamp glitches ('08:12 -> 08:12').
- The narration briefly switches person ("you tremble") and then snaps back.
Occasionally, a line of "gibberish" or cipher text appears as a clue.

These are your "glitch horror" tools, text-only but very effective.[web:13][web:17][web:21]

## Chapter 1 - The First Morning

You wake up in your room. The clock shows **7:00AM, 24th of July**. The day feels wrong, but familiar.
You can stay in bed or get up and check your surroundings.

- **If you stay in bed:**
You lie there, not sleepy, mind spiraling. Trying to sleep again eventually leads to mumbling apparent gibberish like 'Vqtb P  kfku ekmrydN' before blacking out. The player is told this is "not gibberish" and can be decoded as a clue.
- **If you get up:**
You see the strangely empty world outside. You either **talk to the man** whose name you can't remember or **go for a jog**.

**Talk route:**
- You great the man, ask why the road is so empty.He laughs it off "as if you should already know." Later, as you lie back home, you-then wake up again to the same alarm and date.

**Jog route:**
-The jog exhausts you more than it should. You curse youself, then either push harder or stop to get water.
- **Push yourself:** you see a shadow of yourself, smilling at your pain, before fainting. You wake again at 7.00 AM, 24th July.
- **Push yourself:** you see a shadow of yourself, smilling at your pain, before fainting. You wake again at 7.00AM, 24th July.
- ** Buy water:** you enter an empty stall, take a bottle, drink, and start hearing a voice that sounds like you but warped. You tremble, close your eyes, and wake again to the alarm.

Every brance circle back to the same morning:
**DAY 1 -> 7.00 AM -> 24th July.**

The loop is established.

## Chapter 2 - A New Beginning?

The same date. The same digital clock.
You begin to wonder if this is a dream, a 
hallucination, or something worse.

You test reality in a disturbing way:
- You pinch and scratch yourself until you draw blood.
- You find a box full of  bandaids and a note from your mom  telling you to "apply bandaids every time, don't bleed out like the other times."
- Fragmented flashes suggest someone has hurt you before-or you've hurt yourself.

Outside, you meet **Mr . Jager** (now remembered by name). He notices the bandage.
- If you **tell the truth**, you explain the bad dream and hurting yourself; he urges you to be careful with your own body.
- If you **lie**, he laughs at the flimsy excuse and your frail body.
- Either way, attempts to move on-jogging, confronting him, going home-end with accidents(cars, trucks, violence) and you blacking out...

...only to **wake again**.

## Chapter 3 - Scratches in the Paint

You wake up to **"a new day"**, but the clock still shows **7.00Am, 24th July**.

Checking your **surroundings**:
- The room seems normal, but you spot faint **nail scratch marks** on the walls, half-hidden under fresh paint.
- Your own nails are intact. you didn't make those marks-**yet.

Outside:
- Careful or careless choices (helping a thirsty man, ignoring him, walking safely,or not) still end in sudden, senseless violence: stabbings, robberies,crossfire.
- One route introduces **Morse-like text**:
'.. / ... .. / -.-- --- ..- .-. / -... .-.. --- --- -.. -.-- / -... .- -.-. -.- .-.-.-'
This encodes another warning about your body and blood, reinforcing the self-harm/physical danger theme through puzzles.

Every path collapses back into another awakening, pushing you into:

---

## Chapter 4 - Theories and Needles

You wake up determined to **understand**.
You stand before the same clock, the same date and time, and begin forming theories:

- Dream theory:**
  You poke yourself with a needle to "confirm" the dream. The pain is sharp and real; you bandage your arm again.
  - **Time loop theory:**
   You consider jumping from a terrace to test if death truly resets the day, but step back at the last second, terrified.

   You talk to Mr . Jager again:
   - If you **lie**, asking in abstract about
   hallucinations and loops, he dismisses it as fantasy.
   - If you **tell the truth**, he gently tells you to 
   **focus on the present** and stay safe.
   These words echo in your mind like a system prompt:
   "FOCUS ON THE PRESENT."

   Walking the road more cautiously:
   - You avoid the car.
   - You ignore chain chain snatchings.
   - You notice dangers early.
   But the **day still feels wrong**, and the loop still refuses to break.

## Chapter 5 - Divergenge (Two Parallel Paths)

**Chapter 5 splits into two distinct investigative routes** from Chapter 4's convergence. Both paths explore different facets of the loop but **merge into Chapter 6's hallucination reveal**.

### Chapter 5_1 - pushing Limits (Body/Exploration Route)

Instinctive decision to test the world's boundaries through action and pain.

Chapter 5 begins with the protagonist waking up yet again on the same day, overwhemeld and exhaused by the endless repetition. Fed up with the continous loop, they decide this time not to simply endure it, but to actively **test its limits**. They choose to experiment on themselves and the world, to see what truly changes and what always resets.

First, they turn to **pain**. They deliberately aggravate old wounds and put themselves in the path of minor accidents, almost reenacting every injury from the previous loops. Each impact hurts, each cut and bruise feels real, and yet every time they expect to "reset," they still wake back up in the same room, at the same time, on the same date. After pushing as far as they can handle, they force themselves to **calm down**, breathing slowly and going over everything they know: no matter what they do to their body, the morning always returns unchanged. Just as they reach this realization, a **sudden wave of pain** crashes over them, not from any visible injury, but from everywhere at once.

They **faint**, anticipating the usual instant jump-cut to the alarm and the digital clock-but this time, it does not come. Instead, they are trapped in a kind of void, where they hear a **man crying out in agony**. The man describes pain spreading through every part of his body, listing injuries and sensations that disturb the protagonist deeply. What unsettles them most is the familiarity of the descriptions: the pain sounds exactly like what they have been inflicting on themselves in the loop. They cannot move, cannot escape; all they can do is **listen more**, stuck inside this moment for what feels like an eternity. Only after this prolonged exposure do they finally "wake up" again in their room.

Shaken by this experience, the protangonist decides to **test other theories**. They feel an urgent need to understand how the world responds to them, beyond just pain. they split their focus into two broad directions:**checking interactions** with people and **playing with risks** in the environment. On the interaction side, they decide to talk to others-Mr. Joger, a homelessman, or to revisit the school from previous loops-to see if any of them can provide answers,clues, or even small deviations from the script they think they know.

If they choose to **return to the school**, they wander its empty corridors, drawn back to the place where a TV once showed something important. Now the TV is dead and silent, as if it had never mattered at all. They go **deeper** into the building, searching benches, locker rooms, and other spaces. They find **books with many different names on them**, but the pages are completely blank, as if the identities attached to them never had real content. Eventually, deciding there is nothing more to find, they **turn back**-only to discover a **boy sitting alone in a classroom**. Speacking to him yields nothing: he seems mute and deaf, responding only with a normal, neutral smile. It isn't creepy or sad-just disturbingly empty, as if he exists solely to occupy that seat. With no answers gained, the protagonist leaves and returns to the outside world.

On the street, they once again encounter **Mr. Juger** standing in the familiar place at the familiar time. This time, fueled by their experiments and confusion, they choose their questions more deliberately. They can ask him directly about a **time loop**, or about **time** itself. If they ask about the **loop**, he admits he has heard stories-tales of people reliving the same day repeatedly until they accomplish some essential task that finally frees them. But he quickly adds that he doesn't believe any of it, dismissing it as a fairy tale. If they ask about **time**, he laughs, calling it a philosophical topic beyond his ability to explain, brushing it off as something unusual to discuss so casually. The conservation leaves the protagonist with the sense that Juger **knows more than he shows**, but refuses to acknowledge it directly.

By the end of Chapter 5_1, several key ideas crystallize. The protagonist learns that **pain never truly ends**; it simply seems to be displaced, accumulating somewhere else-possibly inside the crying man they heard while unconscious. The world around them feels increasingly **scripted and hollow**: blank books, a silent boy, NPCs repeating roles without genuine depth. Mr.Joger acknowledges the concept of a loop but pretends not to believe in it, hinting at a gap between what he says and what he knows. This route frames the loop as something that may be **real in consequences but unreal in setting**, pushing the protagonist further toward the truth that there is another layer of reality underneath everything they see.
