Story Progression


Chapter 1:
Wake up then game clues, then first deciding option after going out, you decide either to talk to the mysterious man or go for a jog.
Decision1: talk
you decide to talk to this man, who you cant even remember the name of. You ask him why the road is so empty today, he laughs off telling it has to be obvious, as if it is something u have to know.
Decision 2: jog
You go for a jog which oddly makes u very tired, you curse yourself and then continue continue jogging or stop to buy some water.
Back to the first part of chapter 1:
when asked whether you want to sleep there is the option to keep going all the way until u pass away.
The gibberish in the last text is not gibberish, maybe try using a cipher for that, thats the only clue I can give.
Continuing the jog part:
If you continue jogging you faint and restart the day, but if you decide to buy water, you find that there is no one, you pick up a water bottle from an empty stall, drink it and finally hear a voice.
This voice turns out to be someone waking you up, you wake up, turn your alarm off and look at the clock. But this time u can hear other people around.
Continuing the conversation route:
As you finish the conversation with him, you hear the same voice as the other time, but this one is crying, jolting u awake.
You wake up, turn off the alarm and turn back to look at the digital clock which shows both date and time.

Chapter 2:
It is the same day as you saw earlier, (in your dream?). You continue moving ahead with this odd day. You look at the clock in your wall and find the date to be 24th of July at 7:00 A<, you decide to check if the day is real.
You do this in a weird way, by pinching yourself until you see blood. You then bandage yourself and walk out, then you talk to the mysterious man from before, now you remeber him, his name is Mr.Jager.
